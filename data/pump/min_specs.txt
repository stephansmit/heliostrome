ELECTRICAL ARCHITECTURE: permanent_magnet	
# NOTE that the model used to model a pump with so few specs is extremely simplified, and not really consistent with physics...
# '.' are mandatory inputs that should be replaced by specifications or the line should be removed. 
# 'nan' are optional input.
# Units for columns are in the order: 
# [V]	[m]	[A]	[L/min]	[W]	[no unit]
